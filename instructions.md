clearks online through app or web, to facilitate their day to day functuions. in which we will
deliver, chamber/law firm case management system including daily cause list via app and sms

which is considered to be obselite old school version.
along all this, a market place is a must addidtion in this app for lawyers to sell and purchase all
kind of lawyers stuff. including free stuff option in it.

we also dont want to miss Bar Chat rooms for each registered bar in pakistan, along with seprate
clerk bar chat rooms, and eligibility to enter into that bar according to the registered bar
association of lawyer which would be strickly for lawyers only.

to upload the documents it would be quit easy to take picture of the document which would be
set/word as a camscanner as default and upload the said document in the conserned case file and
notify to concerned lawyers, litigants and appointed law clerks under umbrella of associated
lawyer.

there would be a another Election section where each lawyer can vote/poll or change its vote for
a rough estimate for lawyers to know who can win the upcomming elections for each bar
association, along with seprate polling for each bar council elections including pakistan,
islamabad, punjab, sind, kpk, gilgit and including kashmir bar.

this app would also require a plateform for lawyers, where they are available for litigants to hire
and along with their profiles and law firm profiles and assiciated lawyers of that law firm. for
example all the functions available in an already existing app of "ZOR."

this app would also require a payment method where it would me easy to pay through all kinds
of means like jazz cash, easypaisa and through local banks and book different kinds of packages
which are not that cheap, with standard, gold, premium and platinum packages.

related to litigation and should be adapted by everyone in no time.

app must be strong enough to hold all kinds of trafic and hold and analyse data of all litigants
lawyers and every one and can only be seen by the developer. only a lawyer would be able to see
and analyse his own personal or his law firm data.

it would be recomended to have an Lawyers AI serch engine for lawyers to draft contracts etc,
but for developer the AI should be able to analyse data and tell exact registered figures of all
modren kinds available to analyse and recommend inprovements and observe compitetors in
market and their business plans and compete them specially, "www.Pakistanlawsite.com" and "
"ZOR." .
